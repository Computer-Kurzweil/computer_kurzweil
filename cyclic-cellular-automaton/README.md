**Cyclic cellular automaton**

## Abstract
The cyclic cellular automaton is a cellular automaton rule developed by David Griffeath and studied by several other cellular automaton researchers.

In this system, each cell remains unchanged until some neighboring cell has a modular value exactly one unit larger than that of the cell itself, at which point it copies its neighbor's value.

One-dimensional cyclic cellular automata can be interpreted as systems of interacting particles, while cyclic cellular automata in higher dimensions exhibit complex spiraling behavior.
