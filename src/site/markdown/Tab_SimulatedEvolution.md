# Simulated Evolution

**Artificial Life Simulation of Bacteria Motion depending on DNA**

*[back...](TABS.md)* 

## Abstract

Green food appears in a world with red moving cells. These cells eat the food if it is on their position.
Movement of the cells depends on random and their DNA. A fit cell moves around and eats enough to reproduce.
Reproduction is done by splitting the cell and randomly changing the DNA of the two new Cells.
If a cell doesn't eat enough, it will first stand still and after a while it dies.

| Color | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| ![](../../../../etc/tabs/img/simulatedevolution/black.png) | water           |
| ![](../../../../etc/tabs/img/simulatedevolution/green.png) | food            |
| ![](../../../../etc/tabs/img/simulatedevolution/blue.png) | cell is young   |
| ![](../../../../etc/tabs/img/simulatedevolution/yellow.png)  | cell is fat enough to reproduce*   |
| ![](../../../../etc/tabs/img/simulatedevolution/red.png)  | cell is old enough to reproduce*   |
| ![](../../../../etc/tabs/img/simulatedevolution/light_gray.png)  | cell is hungry and waiting for food or death   |
| ![](../../../../etc/tabs/img/simulatedevolution/dark_gray.png)  | cell is old and waiting for death   |
| &nbsp; | * (if cell is fat and old enough for reproduction it splits and changes the childrens DNA)   |
